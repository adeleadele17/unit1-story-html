  <h1>A letter to a friend</h1> 
  <p>Dear friend,
      how are you? i remember that every time when i was sad you cheered me up,and when i couldn't do math you helped me, and where always the 2 girls in the class that singed and laughed,
      and the teachers wouldn't want us to stay toghether becouse we where loud.

  </p>
