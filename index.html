  <h1>A letter to a friend</h1> 
  <p>Dear friend,
      how are you? i remember that every time when i was sad you cheered me up,and when i couldn't do math you helped me, and where always the 2 girls in the class that
      singed and laughed,and the teachers wouldn't want us to stay toghether becouse we where really loud.
      OH! and do you remember the time, when we were design technology and i went to the bathroom for a while and i came back an i saw a picture of adele
      the singer and the song was playing. Or when you  told me out of no where "lo sai che ieri e morto il nonno di mia amica" and i asked myself â€œis she ok!"
      I think the best time we had was probably... when we wanted to high-five but we did it to fast so we didn't even touch each other, so when ever we saw each other in 
      the school halls we did the weard high-five. I remember were positively exited abaut going to Turin ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©
